  sceneTitle: 'Eight minutes above threshold, and four systems holding part of the answer',
  sceneParagraphs: [
    'An overnight operator sees a chilled room breach its threshold and stay there for eight minutes. The reading alone cannot separate a loading door left open, a scheduled defrost, a drifting probe and a genuine risk to product. The building management system, the telemetry platform, the maintenance log and the shift notebook each hold a fragment of the answer.',
    'By the time those fragments are gathered the eight minutes are long past, and the decision that mattered was whether to hold the stock before it moved. A service that added a fifth alerting channel to that night would slow the gathering down. A service that shortened it would change the decision.',

      heading: 'Coverage of the path decides the excursion count',
      paragraphs: [
        { text: 'Ask a temperature-controlled site for its excursion rate and the answer describes its sensors as much as its refrigeration. A site with one probe per chilled room, sampled every fifteen minutes, will report a low rate, because most of what happens to product happens between those points: on a dock, in a trailer, during a transfer, inside a pallet nobody instrumented. The rate is a property of the measurement design before it is a property of the plant.' },
        { text: 'Vaccine distribution is the part of this problem with a published literature, and the literature is blunt. A 2007 systematic review in Vaccine found that studies examining a single storage point or a single leg reported freezing exposure in 14 to 35 percent of cases, while the six studies that measured temperature through every segment of the chain found that between 75 and 100 percent of shipments had been exposed. A 2017 update reported freezing in transport in 16.7 percent of cases in higher-income settings and 35.3 percent in lower-income ones.', sources: [vaccineChainReview, vaccineChainUpdate] },
        { text: 'Chilled food distribution differs from vaccine distribution in tolerance and in consequence. The measurement lesson still applies, because it concerns instrumentation. Where a chain is watched at points, the record shows the points. Where it is watched continuously, the record shows the handovers, and handovers are where product spends most of its unprotected time. Any excursion count taken from a partly instrumented path understates exposure by an unknown margin.' },
        { text: 'For anyone specifying a monitoring service, two things follow. Establish which stretches of the path are dark, and establish whether the organisation is prepared to see a higher excursion count once they are lit. In chilled food operations those stretches are predictable: the transfer between dock and trailer, the hours when a third-party haulier holds the load, and any pallet whose position in the room differs from the probe. A site that installs continuous monitoring and then treats the resulting increase as a fault in the system will have the instrumentation switched off inside a quarter. Discovery should therefore settle current coverage, sampling interval and known blind spots before anybody agrees a threshold.' },

      paragraphs: [
        { text: 'Wider coverage brings more ways to be wrong. Missing heartbeats, implausible jumps, probes reading through a defrost cycle and calibration that drifted three months ago all arrive looking like temperature data. Each should surface as a separate data exception, with the gap left visible on the record. Filling a gap by interpolation, or presenting a suspect reading to one decimal place, conceals exactly the operating risk that matters. A service unable to say which of its readings it trusts is producing an opinion with a unit attached.' },
        { text: 'Security guidance points the same way. NCSC operational technology guidance asks for a definitive view of what is deployed and for data to be validated where it crosses a trust boundary, and its connectivity principles ask for architectural separation when information moves from plant equipment into analytical services. Applied here, those principles stop the monitoring path from becoming a route back into refrigeration control.', sources: [ncscOt, ncscProtocols] },
        { text: 'With validation in place, the distinction the whole design rests on becomes affordable. An alert records that a rule fired. A case carries the validated reading and its duration, the state of the asset, the product and location, the policy that applies, the colleague it is allocated to, the action taken and the evidence that temperature recovered. Whatever is still missing stays visible on the face of the case. The reviewer receives a decision object.' },
        { text: 'Two of those fields do the real work: the identified responder and the stated time to respond. Food Standards Agency guidance pairs monitoring with effective corrective action and leaves the judgement with the business, which means an unassigned excursion satisfies nothing at all. Closure should record what was inspected, what was moved or destroyed and what temperature did afterwards, so that the assurance file becomes a by-product of the response.', sources: [foodStandards] },

Process operations have measured that problem for decades. EEMUA 191 recommends no more than one alarm per operator per ten minutes in normal running and no more than ten alarms in the first ten minutes of an upset, and it pairs those rates with an expected time to respond.', sources: [alarmBenchmark] },

Only two of the 37 came close to the guideline for upset conditions. Those are refineries and chemical plants with dedicated control rooms. A chilled warehouse with one duty manager overnight has considerably less attention to spend.', sources: [alarmBenchmark] },
        { text: 'That objection survives, and it should change the design. Continuous records hold their place in assurance, trend analysis, maintenance planning and retrospective investigation without ever interrupting anybody. A case should form only where signal quality, duration, product and context together clear a threshold the operators themselves agreed, and the number of cases per shift belongs in the specification as a ceiling, tested against history before anything escalates live. A ceiling of that kind is unusual in monitoring specifications and ordinary in process control, which is where the evidence on operator attention comes from. The service should be judged on whether its cases displace work the operator was doing anyway.' },

        { text: 'All of this points to a narrow proposal. Take twelve months of existing telemetry, maintenance records and shift notes for one asset class at one site, and replay them through the proposed policy in observation mode, with nothing reaching a phone. The replay answers three questions before money is committed: how many cases the policy would have raised per shift, which recorded incidents it would have missed, and how many of its cases would have closed as instrumentation faults.' },
        { text: 'Observation mode also prices the dark stretches. Where the replay raises a case that the available data cannot resolve, that case closes as unresolvable, and the count of unresolvable cases is the argument for extending coverage, expressed in the unit an operation cares about, which is decisions it could not make. That count is worth more than a sensor quotation, because it comes from events the site has already had. The same replay shows which of the current alerts nobody acted on, and that list is usually cheaper to fix than the sensor estate.' },
        { text: 'Comparison with current practice should use measures a duty manager recognises: the share of the path under valid signal, the proportion of cases closing as instrumentation faults, the age of the oldest unallocated case, the time from breach to first human action, and the effort now spent assembling evidence for an audit. Any target set against those measures stays a hypothesis until the replay and a live parallel run have produced independent numbers.' },
        { text: 'None of this moves the decision away from the operator. Judgement about whether product is safe stays with the people responsible for it, and a monitoring service implying otherwise would be a liability to the business that bought it. The design offers a faster and more complete account of what happened, assembled while the eight minutes still matter, and a record afterwards that somebody can defend.' },

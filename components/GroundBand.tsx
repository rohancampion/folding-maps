/**
 * One full-bleed band per marketing page, cycling three photographs.
 *
 * Two frames of planting and one of structure, in that order: the first frame
 * is what a visitor on reduced motion sees and the one the browser fetches
 * first, so a band reads as greenery before it reads as concrete.
 *
 * The cycle is CSS. Three overlaid frames, staggered opacity keyframes and a
 * slow scale on each, which means it runs with scripting off and costs no
 * frame budget on the main thread. The only thing React is here for is the
 * pause control: content that animates alone for more than five seconds
 * needs a way to stop it (WCAG 2.2.2), and honouring prefers-reduced-motion
 * covers the people who set it but not the person who simply finds it
 * distracting.
 *
 * Every file is CC0. Titles, creators and sources are recorded per file in
 * public/images/ground/CREDITS.json, which is the licence record and is kept
 * in step with this directory.
